# SOTF-Trials
more or less private research on basic neural networks and how they work

This project was created under Python 3.5.2 and uses pygame for the displayed
window. There is NO IMPLEMENTATION of any neural network activity at the time,
what makes this map generator a base for all upcoming ideas and other features.

The application is started by clicking on main.py
You should then see a window with a procedural generated, tiled map.
The controls are as followed:

- Use the arrow keys or drag the mouse while pressing the right mouse button to
	move around the map.
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out
- Press F2 to generate another map
- Press F3 or F5 to turn on and off the screen
- Press F11 to toggle between windowed and fullscreen mode
- Press F12 to take a screenshot with date and time imformation in 'app' folder

That's it.
Not pretty much at all, but at least it's a base for what I want to achieve

Have fun.
